## What is Perpetual WP?
Perpetual WP removes bloat and delivers straightforward enhancements to your WordPressâ€”no configuration required.

While alternatives like [ClassicPress](https://classicpress.net), which is a full fork of WordPress, Perpetual WP takes a unique approach as a plugin, ensuring full compatibility with the latest version of WordPress.
